# Synth-Controller
Touchscreen controller for a DSI Mopho Synth, and more...

Runs on linux using Kivy.

Requires kivy and alsaseq.

Most of the controls for the mopho are here, not the sequencer yet.

Loading patches not currently working.

The code unique to the mopho synth is now seprate, so the hopefully 
the program could be made to work for other synths.
